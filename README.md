# msfs-copilot

## Idea
This is a side-project that I am working on whenever I find time after work to create a Microsoft Fligth Simulator (MSFS) copilot powered by a fine-tuned davinci model that aims to provide msfs pilots with checklists for various different aircraft.

Initially, this will be done manually by inputting which checklist you want, but the plan is to make turn that into a voice experience.
